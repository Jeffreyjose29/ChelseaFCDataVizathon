## 🧠 Project Overview

**Health Synchronization Engine** is a Power BI dashboard developed for the **Chelsea FC Data Vizathon**, showcasing a unified view of a footballer's health and performance workload. Using **Pedro Neto** as a case example, the dashboard integrates multiple data sources to support coaching and performance staff in athlete monitoring.

### Key Features:
- **GPS Metrics**: High-speed running, acceleration loads  
- **Physical Capabilities**: Isometric and dynamic force output  
- **Recovery Monitoring**: Heart rate zone durations, musculoskeletal markers  
- **Performance Readiness**: Training vs match scenario insights  
- **Custom Tooltips**: Context-rich interactivity within visuals  
- **Data Export**: Download CSVs for deeper analysis

While the current setup focuses on Pedro Neto, the dashboard is scalable to other players. Due to licensing limitations, the dashboard functions offline within Power BI Desktop.

> Built for the **Chelsea FC Performance Analytics** team's Vizathon — a project aimed at bridging the gap between **data and decision-making** in elite football.
